                Dwight is a fictional character on <em>The Office</em> portrayed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainn_Wilson">Rainn Wilson</a>. He is one of the highest
                ranking salesmen as well as the originial assistant to the regional manager, and former Assistant 
                Regional Manger at the paper distribution company Dunder Mifflin. Additionally, he is a bed-and-breakfast
                proprietor at Schrute Farms, a beet plantation owner, and a owner of the business park in which
                Dunder Mifflin exists. He is notorious for his lack of social skills and common sense, his love for martial
                arts and justice system, and his office rivalry with fellow salesman Jim Halpert. He is also known for his 
                romantic relationship with Angela Martin, head of the accounting department. He has at times risen to the 
                position of acting Branch Manager of the Scranton branch, but often serves as a second or third in command 
                as Assistant (to the) Regional Manager. While Dwight was a regional manager in the last few episodes of the 
                series, he named himself the Assistant to the Assistant to the Regional Manager (A.A.R.M). Dwight was also 
                the Vice President of Special Projects Development for the Sabre Corporation, which was the parent company 
                of Dunder Mifflin at the time, but was soon replaced by Todd Packer, who was almost immediately terminated. 
                In the final season, Dwight is offered the position of permanent Regional Manager.
