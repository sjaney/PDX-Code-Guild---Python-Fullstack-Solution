The score is computed by multiplying the number 
of characters divided by the number of words by 4.71, 
adding the number of words divided by the number of sentences 
multiplied by 0.5, and subtracting 21.43. If the result is a decimal, 
always round up, and if the result is higher than 14, it should be set to 14.

# Once youâ€™ve computed the ARI score, you can use the following dictionary to look up the age range and grade level.
